                    When you use Pesums, you're trusting us with your digital life. We understand this responsibility
                    deeply, and we've built Pesums from the ground up to honor that trust. This Privacy Policy explains
                    how we protect your information and put you in complete control.

                <h2 id="privacy-intro">Our Privacy Promise</h2>
                <p>
                    At Pesums, privacy isn't a feature—it's our foundation. Unlike other browsers that claim to protect
                    you while collecting your data, we've taken a radically different approach: we collect nothing. Not
                    your browsing history, not your searches, not your passwords, not your personal information.
                    Nothing.
                    Zero. This isn't marketing speak. This is our technical architecture, our business model, and our
                    commitment to you.

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>The Simple Truth:</strong> We cannot sell, leak, or misuse data we never collect in the
                    first
                    place. Your privacy is guaranteed not by promises, but by design.

                    Your safety online goes beyond privacy. Pesums actively protects you from a wide range of digital
                    threats that could compromise your security, steal your data, or harm your device. Our multi-layered
                    protection system works silently in the background to keep you safe.

                    Pesums Shield is our comprehensive protection layer that blocks threats before they reach you. Every

                    Pesums maintains and constantly updates our threat database using anonymous, aggregated security
                    intelligence. When a new threat is identified anywhere in the world, our entire user base is
                    protected
                    within minutes—without compromising anyone's privacy.

                <h2 id="no-tracking">No Tracking. No Profiling. No Following.</h2>
                <p>
                    Most browsers claim to offer "privacy mode" while still tracking you in countless ways. Pesums is
                    different. We block every known tracking method:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No cookies tracking:</strong> Third-party cookies that follow you across websites are
                        completely blocked.</li>
                    <li><strong>No pixel tracking:</strong> Invisible tracking pixels that report your activity are
                        prevented from loading.</li>
                    <li><strong>No browser fingerprinting:</strong> Websites cannot create unique identifiers based on
                        your browser configuration.</li>
                    <li><strong>No canvas fingerprinting:</strong> Advanced fingerprinting techniques using HTML5 canvas
                        are blocked.</li>
                    <li><strong>No WebGL fingerprinting:</strong> Graphics card fingerprinting is prevented.</li>
                    <li><strong>No audio fingerprinting:</strong> Your audio stack cannot be used to identify you.</li>
                    <li><strong>No font fingerprinting:</strong> Your installed fonts remain private.</li>
                    <li><strong>No cross-site tracking:</strong> You cannot be followed from one website to another.

                <h2 id="how-we-work">How Pesums Works Without Your Data</h2>
                <p>
                    You might wonder: if we don't collect data, how does Pesums function? The answer is
                    simple—everything
                    happens locally on your device. Your bookmarks, history (if you choose to keep one), passwords, and
                    settings are all stored on your computer, encrypted and private. Pesums never sends this information
                    to our servers because we don't have servers collecting user data.
                </p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Technical Guarantee:</strong> Pesums is architected so that user data never leaves your
                    device. This isn't a policy we could change—it's how the software is built.
                </div>
                <h2 id="open-source">Open Source & Transparent</h2>
                <p>
                    Pesums is built on open-source technology, which means our code is publicly available for anyone to
                    inspect. Security researchers, privacy advocates, and developers worldwide can verify that we do
                    exactly what we say we do. No backdoors. No hidden trackers. No secret data collection. When we say
                    we protect your privacy, you don't have to take our word for it—you can verify it yourself.
                </p>
                <h2 id="your-control">You're in Complete Control</h2>
                <p>
                    While Pesums doesn't collect your data, we give you full control over the data that stays on your
                    device:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clear browsing data anytime:</strong> Delete your local history, cache, and cookies
                        whenever you want.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Take your bookmarks and settings with you if you switch
                        devices
                        or browsers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Private browsing mode:</strong> Browse without saving any local history at all.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sync settings (optional):</strong> If you choose to sync settings across devices, data
                        is
                        end-to-end encrypted and we cannot read it.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <h2 id="no-third-parties">No Third Parties. No Exceptions.</h2>
                <p>
                    We don't share data with third parties because we don't have data to share. No analytics companies.
                    No
                    advertising networks. No data brokers. No government agencies (unless legally required with a valid
                    warrant for specific criminal investigations, and even then, we have nothing to provide). No
                    exceptions.

                <h2 id="children-privacy">Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Pesums is safe for users of all ages. Because we don't collect any personal information, we don't
                    have
                    special requirements for children's data—we treat everyone's privacy equally: we protect it
                    absolutely.

                <p>
                    If we ever need to update this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you through the browser and post the
                    changes here. Our commitment to zero data collection will never change—that's a core principle of

                    You may stop using Pesums at any time by uninstalling the browser from your devices. We may
                    terminate
                    or suspend your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause or notice, if we believe

                    However,
                    provisions that by their nature should survive termination (including disclaimers, limitations of
                    liability, and dispute resolution) will continue to apply.

                <h2 id="changes-terms">Changes to These Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our Service, legal requirements,
                    or
                    business practices. When we make changes, we will post the updated Terms and update the "Last

                    limited
                    or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full
