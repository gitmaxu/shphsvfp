# PESUMS Browser

A privacy-first web browser built on the principle that your data belongs to you, and only you.

## What is PESUMS?

PESUMS is a web browser designed from the ground up to eliminate tracking, data collection, and surveillance. While other browsers claim privacy, PESUMS takes a different approach: we don't collect your data because we have no infrastructure to store it. Zero data collection isn't a policy we follow—it's technically impossible for us to violate.

## Core Principles

**Zero Data Collection**
We don't collect browsing history, passwords, searches, downloads, or any personal information. Not because we promise not to, but because our architecture doesn't support it. Your data never leaves your device.

**Local-First Design**
Everything runs on your machine. Search caches, history, passwords, settings—all stored locally in an encrypted database. No cloud sync, no external servers, no data transmission.

**No Compromises**
Free forever. No premium tiers. No ads. No partnerships with data brokers. Privacy isn't a feature you pay for; it's the foundation.

## Key Features

### PESUMS Shield
Our flagship protection system that operates entirely on-device:

- **Aggressive Blocking Mode**: Eliminates trackers, malicious scripts, fingerprinting attempts, and advertisements before they load
- **Standard Blocking Mode**: Balanced protection that maintains site functionality while blocking known threats
- **Fingerprinting Protection**: Prevents websites from creating unique device signatures to track you across the web
- **Cookie Control**: Granular control over all cookies or selective blocking of third-party trackers

All processing happens locally. No data sent to external servers for analysis.

### Search and Navigation
- Multiple search engine support (Brave Search, Mojeek, DuckDuckGo, and more)
- Offline search optimization with local caching
- Intelligent suggestions without transmitting your queries
- HTTPS everywhere with automatic secure connection upgrades

### Security Tools
- Local password manager with device-only encrypted storage
- Offline browsing history that never syncs
- Tab management with optional session restoration
- Malware and phishing protection processed on-device

## Technical Details

PESUMS operates on a local-first architecture where all features are designed to function without internet connectivity for core operations:

- History, passwords, and settings stored in local encrypted database
- Search suggestions and caches maintained offline
- Protection rules and blocklists updated separately from browsing activity
- No telemetry, analytics, or usage statistics transmitted

## Platform Support

- Linux
- Android
- macOS  
- iOS
- Windows

## Philosophy

Most browsers treat privacy as a marketing feature while continuing to collect and analyze user data. PESUMS takes a different position: if we don't have the capability to collect your information, we can't leak it, sell it, or be compelled to hand it over.

Privacy should be the default state, not a premium feature or a setting buried in preferences. PESUMS is built for people who believe their browsing activity is nobody's business but their own.

## Development Status

PESUMS is currently in active development. The browser is approximately 90% complete, with core privacy and security features fully implemented. We're refining performance, expanding platform support, and conducting security audits before public release.

## Funding

PESUMS is independently developed without venture capital or corporate backing. This project exists to prove that privacy-focused software can thrive without compromising user trust for investor returns.
If you believe in a web where privacy is a right rather than a product, and you want to support this mission, funding opportunities are open. Whether through contributions, partnerships, or sponsorships that align with our principles, we welcome conversations with those who share our vision.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why trust PESUMS over other privacy browsers?**
Don't trust us. Verify. The code will be open source, allowing independent security researchers to audit our claims. More importantly, our architecture makes data collection technically infeasible, not just policy-forbidden.

**How is this funded without collecting data?**
Through optional community support and donations. Privacy-focused users who value the project contribute to keep it independent and free for everyone.

**What about updates and security patches?**
Browser updates and security definitions are delivered separately from any browsing activity. Your usage patterns are never transmitted, even for update purposes.

**Can websites tell I'm using PESUMS?**
Websites can detect browser type through standard headers, but PESUMS prevents the advanced fingerprinting techniques used to uniquely identify and track individual users across sessions.

**Is blocking ads and trackers legal?**
Absolutely. You have every right to control what runs on your device and what content you choose to view or ignore.
